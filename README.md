- üëã Hello, my name is Brian Kies from San Antonio, Texas.
- üëÄ I am interested in a remote part-time programming job. I graduated Magna Cum Laude 
     from St. Mary's University in San Antonio with a degree in Computer Science
     and a minor in Mathematics.
- üå± For the last couple of years I have been working exclusively with Java NetBeans and MySql. I have uploaded to GitHub four programs written during this time. Two of the          programs use the Swing pallette for adding components and I manually coded componets for the other two. I have previously worked with C, C++, C Sharp, Java, Basic, Pascal,      and a little COBOL.
     Here is a synopsis of each program with an item or two about the code.
     
     U.S. Flag Histories:
     
     This program looks at the history of the first four U.S. flags along with our present day flag.
     
     I have written a separate class (BetsyRoss, LewisAndClark, etc.) for each flag and each extends a Flag base class. The base class sets width and height, 
     colors, stripes and canton dimensions, and has methods for drawing the stripes and canton. Only white stripes are drawn (every other stripe width) 
     as the red background takes care of red stripes. The Lewis & Clark flag has its own method for drawing stripes as it is the only flag to have had
     more than thirteen stripes. Each flag has its own method for drawing stars as they are different for each flag. For the BetsyRossFlag I used Math.Pi,
     Math.Sin, and Math.Cos funcitons to draw the thirteen stars in a circle.
     
     Ray Of Light: 
     
     This program looks at a math problem I thought of regarding a ray of light emitted from the top of a 10-foot pole. Since the ray of light forms the hypotenuse 
     of a right triangle, at what distances does the ray of light strike the surface as it approaches 90 degrees. In particular, at what distance does it strike the
     surface just before it is at 90 degrees and perpendicular to the surface?
     
     I had to experiment with GridBag layout on this one to display panel components proportionately upon resizing of window. It uses the Math.toRadians, Math.PI,
     and Math.tan functions to compute the various distances. 
     
     Ratios:
     This is one of two programs that involves aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic. This one looks at the lack of U.S. leadership and analyzes a ratio which shows
     South Korea's handling of the crisis has resulted in far less loss of life.
     
     The program displays six sequential pages with each page being a class. Again, as in the Flag program, each extends a Page base class which has common counter and 
     location variables for all pages. Three different timers are used: one for page scripts written across and down screen, one for JLabel that counts lives lost, and 
     one for picture frame (JLabel with Image Icons) displaying chronological images from pandemic. I designed this program where it cannot be moved or minimized and
     manually added a X Close button in the upper right corner. Since the script continually moves across and down the screen, it would be too difficult to replicate
     if the window was repainted. 
     
     The program retrieves data from a MySql database I created that stores pandemic numbers since March 1, 2020 to the present. The data has been taken from the
     New York Times and Washington Post websistes. 
     
     I learned about web scraping for this project and extracted data from the Worldmeters website to obtain current South Korea case total and South Korea and
     U.S. populations. This information displays as fractions on the cover page.
     
     I also added buttons for Page Two through Page Six. You can then select a definite page and view if the text isw working instead of waiting each time 
     for the program to circle round from Page One.
     
     Pandemic:
     
     This program uses the MySql database I created to store pandemic numbers since March 1, 2020. It uses ResultSets to retrieve the data and PreparedStatements to
     execute MySql commands on the data. The user The user can also draw charts by selecting a date range and category (Total Cases, Average Cases, Total Deaths, etc.) If you
     maintain a separate CSV spreadsheet of the data (I use Open Office), you can imort the file into the program. You are able to export the table as well. 
     
- üíûÔ∏è I currently work for UPS as an Account Manager. I have been employed there for 15 years. I previoulsy worked several years for AT&T. 
- I am looking forward to hearing back on remote part-time programming postions.
