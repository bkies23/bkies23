- 👋 Hello, my name is Brian Kies.
- 👀 I am interested in a remote part-time programming job. I graduated Magna Cum Laude 
     from St. Mary's University in San Antonio, TX with a degree in Computer Science
     and a minor in Mathematics.
- 🌱 For the last year and a half I have worked exclusively with Java NetBeans
     and MySql. During this time I have written four programs that have been 
     uploaded to GitHub. I used the Swing pallette for two of these programs and
     manually coded components and layout managers for the other two.
     Here is a synopsis of each program with an item ot two for each I am proud of.
     
     U.S. Flag Histories - This program looks at the history of the first four U.S. flags.
    
     
- 💞️ I am looking forward to 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
