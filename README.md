- 👋 Hello, my name is Brian Kies from San Antonio, Texas.
- 👀 I am approaching retirement from UPS after 18 years and I am interested in a remote part-time programming job. I graduated Magna Cum Laude 
     from St. Mary's University in San Antonio with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.    
- 🌱 For the last few years I have been working with Java NetBeans and some MySQL. I designed and coded three programs which I have pushed to this GitHub site. The programs use Swing palette components and components I added manually.
- I have been studying Python for a couple of years and two of the programs (HYP_SOLVER and FIBO) on GitHub are written in that language.
- Previously I have worked with C, C++, Basic, Pascal, and some COBOL.

- Each of the Java projects has a .JAR file in the store folder (package-for-store) under its master branch. You can download the .JAR file to execute the program. The code for each project is in its repository. The Python executables are under their respective Dist       folders. 

- The README file for each project explains the program along with some thoughts on coding.
     
     U.S. Flag Histories:
     
     This program looks at the history of the first four U.S. flags along with our present-day flag.
    
     LightBeam: 
     
     This program examines a math problem I thought of regarding a beam of light emitted from the top of a 10-foot pole. It grapically shows the increasing distances for the opposite side (or surface) as the angle between the ten-foot pole and the beam of light (starts 
     at 75°) approaches 90°.
     
     Pandemic:
     
     This program tracks Covid19 data from March 1, 2020 through March 17, 2023. In March of 2023 the New York Times and Washington Post stopped tracking the virus daily and I stopped inputting data after 3-17-2023. A  user can still add ficticious data after 3-17-2023 
     and modify, delete or insert rows to see how the program works. Users can view the data with tables and charts.

     HYP_SOLVER:

     This program lets a user solve the hypotenuse for right triangle by either using two sides, an adjacent side and cosine of angle, or opposite side and sine of angle.

     FIBO:

     This program lets user select or input index that is then used to display Fibonacci element from list. 

   
- 💞️ I currently work for UPS as an Account Manager and have been remote for the last five years. I have been employed with UPS for 18 years. Previously, I worked several years for AT&T. 
-    I look forward to hearing back on remote part-time programming postions.
