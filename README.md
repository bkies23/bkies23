- üëã Hello, my name is Brian Kies from San Antonio, Texas.
- üëÄ I am interested in a remote part-time programming job. I graduated Magna Cum Laude 
     from St. Mary's University in San Antonio with a degree in Computer Science
     and a minor in Mathematics.    
- üå± For the last few years I have been working with Java NetBeans and MySQL. I designed and coded four programs during this time which are now on my GitHub site: github.com\bkies23                                                      
- Two of the programs use Swing palette components and for the other two programs I added components manually. I have previously worked with C, C++, C Sharp, Basic, Pascal, and a little COBOL.

- Each project has a .JAR file which can be downloaded from the Master branch to execute the program. The code for the project is in each repository. 

- The README file for each project explains the program along with thoughts on how I coded it.
     
     U.S. Flag Histories:
     
     This program looks at the history of the first four U.S. flags along with our present day flag.
    
     LightBeam: 
     
     This program looks at a math problem I thought of regarding a beam of light emitted from the top of a 10-foot pole. Since the ray of light forms the hypotenuse 
     of a right triangle with surfaces, at what distances does the ray strike a surface as it approaches 90 degrees. In particular, at what distance does it                strike just before it is at 90 degrees and perpendicular to the surface?
     
     Pandemic:
     
     This program tracks Covid19 data from March 1, 2020 through March 17, 2023. In March of 2023 the New York Times and Washington Post stopped tracking the virus daily. Since this is the data I used for the program I stopped inputting it with the 3-17-2023 date. A          user can still add ficticious data after 3-17-2023 to see how the program works. Users can view and manipulate the data with tables and charts.
     
   
- üíûÔ∏è I currently work for UPS as an Account Manager. I have been employed there for 16 years. I previously worked several years for AT&T. 
-    I look forward to hearing back on remote part-time programming postions.
