- üëã Hello, my name is Brian Kies from San Antonio, Texas.
- üëÄ I am interested in a remote part-time programming job. I graduated Magna Cum Laude 
     from St. Mary's University in San Antonio with a degree in Computer Science
     and a minor in Mathematics.    
- üå± For the last few years I have been working with Java NetBeans and MySQL. I designed and coded three programs which I have pushed onto my GitHub site: github.com/bkies23                                                      
- The programs use a combination of Swing palette components and components added manually.
- I have recently been studying Python and the fourth program (TrigLesson) is written with that language.
- I previously worked with C, C++, C Sharp, Basic, Pascal, and a little COBOL.

- Each project has a .JAR file under store folder (package-for-store) in master branch which you can download to execute the program. The code for each project is in its repository. 

- The README file for each project explains the program along with some thoughts on coding.
     
     U.S. Flag Histories:
     
     This program looks at the history of the first four U.S. flags along with our present-day flag.
    
     LightBeam: 
     
     This program looks at a math problem I thought of regarding a beam of light emitted from the top of a 10-foot pole. Since the ray of light forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with a surface,
     at what distances does the ray strike the surface as it approaches 90 degrees. In particular, at what distance does it strike just before it is at 90 degrees and horizontal or perpendicular to the surface?
     
     Pandemic:
     
     This program tracks Covid19 data from March 1, 2020 through March 17, 2023. In March of 2023 the New York Times and Washington Post stopped tracking the virus daily. Since this is the data I used for the program I stopped inputting it with the 3-17-2023 date. A            user can still add ficticious data after 3-17-2023 to see how the program works. Users can view and manipulate the data with tables and charts.
     
   
- üíûÔ∏è I currently work for UPS as an Account Manager. I have been employed there for 17 years. Previously I worked for several years with AT&T. 
-    I look forward to hearing back on remote part-time programming postions.
