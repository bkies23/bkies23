- 👋 Hello, my name is Brian Kies from San Antonio, Texas.
- 👀 I am interested in a remote part-time programming job. I graduated Magna Cum Laude 
     from St. Mary's University in San Antonio with a degree in Computer Science
     and a minor in Mathematics.
- 🌱 For the last year and a half I have been working with Java NetBeans
     and MySql. During this time I have written four programs which I have
     uploaded to GitHub.  For two programs I used the Swing pallette and
     for two I manually coded components and layout managers.
     
     Here is a synopsis of each program with an item or two about their coding.
     
     U.S. Flag Histories - This program looks at the history of the first four U.S. flags 
     along with our present day flag. It extends a base class Flag which sets colors, stripes 
     and canton dimensions, and has methods to draw both stripes and canton.   
    
     
- 💞️ I am looking forward to 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
