- 👋 Hello, my name is Brian Kies from San Antonio, Texas.
- 👀 I am interested in a remote part-time programming job. I graduated Magna Cum Laude 
     from St. Mary's University in San Antonio with a degree in Computer Science
     and a minor in Mathematics.    
- 🌱 For the last few years I have been working with Java NetBeans and MySQL. I designed and coded three programs which I have pushed to this GitHub site: github.com/bkies23                                                      
- The programs use a combination of Swing palette components and components added manually.
- I have recently been studying Python and a fourth program (TrigLesson) is written in that language.
- I previously worked with C, C++, C Sharp, Basic, Pascal, and a little COBOL.

- Each project has a .JAR file in the store folder (package-for-store) under master branch. You can download it to execute the program. The code for each project is in its repository. 

- The README file for each project explains the program along with some thoughts on coding.
     
     U.S. Flag Histories:
     
     This program looks at the history of the first four U.S. flags along with our present-day flag.
    
     LightBeam: 
     
     This program examines a math problem I thought of regarding a beam of light emitted from the top of a 10-foot pole. It grapically shows the increasing distances for the opposite side (or surface) as the angle between the ten-foot pole and the beam of light (starts 
     at 75°) approaches 90°.
     
     Pandemic:
     
     This program tracks Covid19 data from March 1, 2020 through March 17, 2023. In March of 2023 the New York Times and Washington Post stopped tracking the virus daily and I stopped inputting data after 3-17-2023. A  user can still add ficticious data after 3-17-2023 
     or modify, delete and insert rows to see how the program works. Users can also view the data with tables and charts.

     TrigLesson:

     This program lets a user solve hypotenuse for right triangle by either using two sides, an adjacent side and cosine of angle, or opposite side and sine of angle. 
     
   
- 💞️ I currently work for UPS as an Account Manager and have been remote for the last three years. I have been employed with UPS for 17 years. Previously I worked several years for AT&T. 
-    I look forward to hearing back on remote part-time programming postions.
