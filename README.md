- 👋 Hello, my name is Brian Kies from San Antonio, Texas.
- 👀 I am interested in a remote part-time programming job. I graduated Magna Cum Laude 
     from St. Mary's University in San Antonio with a degree in Computer Science
     and a minor in Mathematics.
     
- 🌱 For the last couple of years I have neen working exclusively with Java NetBeans and MySQL. I designed and coded four programs during this time which are now           on my GitHub site:
-                                           github.com\bkies23                                                      
-   Two of the programs use Swing palette components and I manually added components for the other two programs. I have previously worked with C,       C++, C Sharp, Basic, Pascal, and a little COBOL.

     Each project has a .JAR file which can be downloaded from the Master branch to execute the program. The code for the project is in each repository. 

     The README file for each project explains the program along with thoughts on how I coded it.
     
     U.S. Flag Histories:
     
     This program looks at the history of the first four U.S. flags along with our present day flag.
    
     LightBeam: 
     
     This program looks at a math problem I thought of regarding a beam of light emitted from the top of a 10-foot pole. Since the ray of light forms the hypotenuse 
     of a right triangle with surfaces, at what distances does the ray strike a surface as it approaches 90 degrees. In particular, at what distance does it                strike just before it is at 90 degrees and perpendicular to the surface?
     
     Ratios:
     
     This is one of two programs involving aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic. This one looks at the lack of U.S. leadership and analyzes a ratio to show how South            Korea's handling of the crisis led to far less loss of life.
 
     Pandemic:
     
     This program tracks Covid19 data from March 1, 2020 through the most recent completeed month. Users can view and manipulate the data using tables and charts.
     
   
- 💞️ I currently work for UPS as an Account Manager. I have been employed there for 16 years. I previously worked several years for AT&T. 
-    I am looking forward to hearing back on remote part-time programming postions.
