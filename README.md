- 👋 Hello, my name is Brian Kies from San Antonio, Texas.
- 👀 I am interested in a remote part-time programming job. I graduated Magna Cum Laude 
     from St. Mary's University in San Antonio with a degree in Computer Science
     and a minor in Mathematics.
- 🌱 For the last year and a half I have been working with Java NetBeans and MySql. 
-    During this time I have written four programs which have been uploaded to GitHub.  
-    Two of the programs use the Swing pallette for components and I have manually coded the other two.     
     Here is a synopsis of each program with an item or two about their coding.
     
     U.S. Flag Histories:
     This program looks at the history of the first four U.S. flags along with our present day flag.
     I have written a separate class (BetsyRoss, LewisAndClark, etc.) for each flag and they each extend a Flag base class which sets flag width and height, 
     colors, stripes and canton dimensions, and has methods for drawing stripes and canton. Only white stripes are drawn (every other stripe width) as the red
     background takes care of red stripes. The Lewis & Clark flag is the only one with its own method for drawing stripes since it is the only flag with more
     than thirteen stripes.
     
     Ray Of Light:
     This program looks at a math problem I thought of regarding a ray of light emitted from the top of a 10-foot pole. The ray of light forms the hypotenuse 
     of a right triangle. At what distances does the ray of light strike the surface as it approaches 90 degrees, in particular, at what distance just before it
     is at degrees and perpendicular to the surface?
     I had to experiment with the GridBag layout in order to draw panel componehts proportionately with the resizing of the window.
     Ratios:
