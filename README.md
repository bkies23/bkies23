- üëã Hello, my name is Brian Kies from San Antonio, Texas.
- üëÄ I am interested in a remote part-time programming job. I graduated Magna Cum Laude 
     from St. Mary's University in San Antonio with a degree in Computer Science
     and a minor in Mathematics.
- üå± For the last year and a half I have been working with Java NetBeans and MySql. 
-    During this time I have written four programs which have been uploaded to GitHub.  
-    Two of the programs use the Swing pallette for adding components and I manually added components for the other two.
-    I have previously worked with C, Basic, Pascal, and studied a little COBOL. 
-        
     Here is a synopsis of each program with an item or two about the code.
     
     U.S. Flag Histories:
     This program looks at the history of the first four U.S. flags along with our present day flag.
     
     I have written a separate class (BetsyRoss, LewisAndClark, etc.) for each flag and each extends a Flag base class which sets flag width and height, 
     colors, stripes and canton dimensions, and has methods for drawing the stripes and canton. Only white stripes are drawn (every other stripe width) 
     as the red background takes care of red stripes. The Lewis & Clark flag has its own method for drawing stripes as it is the only flag to have had
     more than thirteen stripes. Each class has its own method for drawing stars as the stars are different for each flag. For the BetsyRossFlag I used  
     the Math.Pi, Math.Sin, and Math.Cos funcitons to draw the thirteen stars in a circle.
     
     Ray Of Light:
     This program looks at a math problem I thought of regarding a ray of light emitted from the top of a 10-foot pole. Since the ray of light forms the hypotenuse 
     of a right triangle, at what distances does the ray of light strike the surface as it approaches 90 degrees. In particular, at what distance does it strike the
     surface just before it is at 90 degrees and perpendicular to the surface?
     
     I had to experiment with GridBag layout on this one in order to display panel components proportionately upon resizing of window. It uses the tangent funcion
     to compute the various distances. 
     
     Ratios:
     This is one of two programs that involves aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic. This one looks at the lack of U.S. leadership and analyzes a ratio which reveals
     South Korea's handling of the crisis resulted in far less loss of life.
     
     The program displays six sequential pages with each page being a class. Again, as in the Flag program, each page extends a Page base class which has timer and 
     location variables for each page. The program uses three timers: one for page scripts across and down the screen, one for a JLabel that counts lives lost, and 
     one for a picture frame (JLabel with Image Icon) that displays chronological images from the pandemic. I designed this program where it cannot be moved or minimized 
     (manually added a X Close button in the upper right corner), since the script continually moves across and down the screen, it would be too difficult
     to replicate whatever script is on the screen if window is repainted.
     
     I learned about web scraping for this project in order to extraxt current data fron the World
     
     I also added buttons for Page Two through Page Six. This way you can select a certain page to view if text looks good instead of waiting each time 
     for the program to circle around from Page One.
