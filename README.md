- 👋 Hello, my name is Brian Kies from San Antonio, Texas.
- 👀 I am interested in a remote part-time programming job. I graduated Magna Cum Laude 
     from St. Mary's University in San Antonio with a degree in Computer Science
     and a minor in Mathematics.
- 🌱 For the last year and a half I have been working with Java NetBeans and MySql. 
-    During this time I have written four programs which I have uploaded to GitHub.  
-    Two of the programs use the Swing pallette for construction of components and the other two are manually coded.
     
     Here is a synopsis of each program with an item or two about their coding.
     
     U.S. Flag Histories:
     This program looks at the history of the first four U.S. flags  along with our present day flag.
     It extends a Flag class which sets the colors, stripe and canton dimensions, and methods for drawing
     stripes and canton. Only white stripes are drawn every other stripe width as a red
     background takes care of the red stripes. And the Lewis & Clark flag is the only one 
     to have its own method for drawing stripes since it is the one flag to have more than
     thirteen stripes.
     
     Ray Of Light:
     This program looks at a math problem I thought of regarding a ray of light emitted from the top of a 10-foot pole which forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle.
     At what distances does the ray of light strike the surface as it approaches 90 degrees, in particular, at what distance just before it is at 90 degrees and 
     perpendicular to the surface?
     
     
    
     
- 💞️ I am looking forward to 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
